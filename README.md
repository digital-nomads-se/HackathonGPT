# HackathonGPT Chat App

## Project Overview

Welcome to the HackathonGPT Chat App repository! This application, developed specifically for Hackathon challenge, is built in Python and offers an innovative way to interact with PDF and CSV documents. It's designed to allow users to engage in a chat-like experience with pre-loaded documents.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Experience**: The application enables users to ask questions in natural language about the contents of pre-loaded PDF and CSV files.
- **Intelligent Response System**: Leveraging a sophisticated language model, the app is capable of generating accurate and relevant responses based on the information contained within the documents.
- **Focused Content Interaction**: It's important to note that the application's responses are confined to the context and data available in the loaded PDFs and CSVs. 

## Usage

To get started, simply load your PDF and CSV documents into the app. Once they're loaded, you're all set to begin asking questions and receiving information directly from the contents of these documents.
